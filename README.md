Repository for the NISHAVA 1227361 Course.

This repository only contains files and homework assignments that are required as part of the course listed above.

It also contains a docker container I created for the course, adding tools I felt helped throughout.

The docker container contains:
	*  ssh utilities
	*  Azure CLI
	*  Powershell
	*  Azure Powershell


The container may still be in the process of being developed.
